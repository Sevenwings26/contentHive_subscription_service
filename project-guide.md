### Guide to Building the **Subscription-Based Content API**

Below is a step-by-step guide for implementing the project, ensuring it covers all the features:

---

#### **Step 1: Plan the API Structure**
1. **Define the Features:**
   - CRUD operations for content.
   - Subscription plans (tiers like free, premium).
   - Payment processing for subscriptions.
   - Access control for content.
   - Analytics for user engagement.

2. **Determine Key Models:**
   - **User**: To manage user authentication and profile.
   - **Content**: To store different types of content (video, article, tutorial).
   - **Subscription Plan**: To define plan tiers and details (e.g., price, duration).
   - **User Subscription**: To link users with their subscription plans and expiration dates.
   - **Engagement**: To track user activity like views or downloads.

---

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Environment**
1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - FastAPI: `pip install fastapi`
   - Uvicorn: `pip install uvicorn`
   - Database Integration: `pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary`
   - Authentication: `pip install fastapi-users`
   - Payment Gateway: `pip install stripe`
   - Docker: To containerize the application.

3. **Initialize the Project:**
   - Create a folder structure:
     ```
     src/
       ├── app/
       │   ├── main.py
       │   ├── models.py
       │   ├── schemas.py
       │   ├── routers/
       │   ├── services/
       ├── tests/
     ```

#### **Step 3: Implement Features**
1. **Content Management (CRUD):**
   - Create a `Content` model with fields like `id`, `type`, `title`, `description`, `file_url`, etc.
   - Build routes to create, read, update, and delete content.
   - Include pagination for listing content efficiently.

2. **Subscription Plans:**
   - Create a `SubscriptionPlan` model with fields like `id`, `name`, `price`, `duration`, and `features`.
   - Add routes for admins to create/manage subscription plans.
   - Add a route for users to view available subscription plans.

3. **Payment Integration:**
   - Set up Stripe:
     - Create a Stripe account and get API keys.
     - Use Stripe's Python SDK to handle payment intents and subscriptions.
   - Add routes to handle:
     - Initiating payments.
     - Webhook to confirm payment success.
   - Store payment status in a `UserSubscription` model.

4. **User Access Control:**
   - Use JWT-based authentication to secure routes.
   - Add middleware or utility to check user subscription status before granting content access.
   - Include roles (`admin`, `subscriber`) for route-specific permissions.

5. **Analytics:**
   - Create an `Engagement` model to track user interactions with content (e.g., views, likes, downloads).
   - Build endpoints to fetch analytics data for admin dashboards.

---

#### **Step 4: Database Setup**
1. **Design Database Schema:**
   - Use SQLAlchemy to define models for PostgreSQL.
   - Create relationships between models (e.g., `User` ↔ `UserSubscription`).
2. **Migrate the Database:**
   - Use Alembic for migrations.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     alembic init migrations
     alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"
     alembic upgrade head
     ```

---

#### **Step 5: Add Authentication**
1. **Use FastAPI Users for User Management:**
   - Implement registration, login, and password management.
   - Extend the `User` model to include additional fields like `is_subscribed` and `subscription_expiry`.

2. **Secure Routes:**
   - Add route dependencies to restrict access to content based on subscription plans.

---

#### **Step 6: Dockerize the Application**
1. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.10-slim
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   COPY . .
   CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
   ```
2. **Set Up a `docker-compose.yml` file:**
   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     api:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/dbname
     db:
       image: postgres:13
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: user
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
         POSTGRES_DB: dbname
   ```

3. **Run Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

---

#### **Step 7: Deploy the Application**
1. **Deploy to Render or AWS:**
   - Render: Add a `render.yaml` file for deployment.
   - AWS: Use Elastic Beanstalk or ECS with a Dockerized application.
2. **Set Up CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Integrate GitHub Actions for automatic builds and deployments.

---

#### **Step 8: Testing**
1. **Write Unit Tests:**
   - Use `pytest` to test individual endpoints and services.
   - Test authentication, content access, payment flow, etc.
2. **Test API Documentation:**
   - FastAPI automatically generates Swagger docs at `/docs`.

---

#### **Step 9: Monitor & Optimize**
1. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Use tools like Sentry or ELK stack for monitoring errors.
2. **Optimize Performance:**
   - Cache frequently accessed content using Redis.
   - Profile and optimize database queries with tools like SQLAlchemy’s query inspector.
